* Signals and systems
  * Linear Convolution is a mathematical method to find the output of Linear Time Invarient(LTI) system when its input signal and transfer function is given .It is applicable for both continous and discrete-time signals. For a input discrete time signal x(n) and the transfer function h(n) the linear convolution of the signal is represented as
y(n)= x(n) * h(n)
  * Circular Convolution
  * Cross Correlation
  * Auto Correlation
